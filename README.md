# 🚀 Skill Mismatch Roadmap Generator

> **Status:** 🛠️ *Currently under development (Work in Progress)*

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Skill Mismatch Roadmap Generator** is a smart career-focused project designed to identify the gap between a user's **current skills** and the **skills required** for a target role. Based on this mismatch, the system generates a **personalized learning roadmap** to help users upskill efficiently.

This project aims to support students, job-seekers, and career switchers by providing **clear, structured, and actionable learning paths** instead of random course recommendations.
